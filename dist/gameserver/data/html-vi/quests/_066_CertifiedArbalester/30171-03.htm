One of the Beleth's buddies found out something about the Kamael. This information was found in a medical books of the Giants.
 
Our lord heard that this information is now available to all Beleth's accomplices in Oren, and transferred to other places too.
 
A spy was a senior official in Giran-city, but we couldn't judge him...
 
Situation is very serious, we have only one solution...
 
I hope you understand me.
