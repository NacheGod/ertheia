Did you forget your mission? It`s to defeat the 
Husk Crawlers in the Military Compound!
<br>
First you must take the key I gave you to <font color="LEVEL">Holden</font> 
at the <font color="LEVEL">Military Compound Entrance</font>. Tell him 
you`ve come to defeat the Husk Crawlers, and 
he`ll let you in.
<br>
If you lose key, come back to me. Once 
you`ve defeated all the Husk Crawlers, report to 
<font color="LEVEL">Shannon</font> at the <font color="LEVEL">Training Grounds</font>.
