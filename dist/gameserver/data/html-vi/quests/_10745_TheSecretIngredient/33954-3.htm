Oh, you've managed to come back in one piece!<br>
No no, don't look at me like that. I'm just relieved that you came back safely. I wasn't worried, if that's what you're thinking. Hm hm.<br>
But, there's still something you need to do for me. I can continue to do research here thanks to <font color="LEVEL">Karla</font>, and she asks that I create a strong armor for a fox in return..<br>
