Master Katalin:<br>
I heard you and Karla talking about Kain. Perhaps it's because I really wanted to know what happened ever since you got here. And I could hear everything you and Karla talked about. Could it be a hidden ability of mine? I'm just kidding. Don't make that face.<br>
You are ready for your 2nd Liberation now. Choose what you like among what I have.<br>
