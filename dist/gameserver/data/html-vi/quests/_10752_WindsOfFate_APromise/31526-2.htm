Broken Bookshelf:<br>
There's an envelope peeking out between these old books.<br>
Can't really see the writing because it's so old, but there is the name of <font color="LEVEL">&quot;Giselle&quot;</font>.<br>
<Button ALIGN=LEFT ICON="Normal" action="bypass -h Quest _10752_WindsOfFate_APromise 31526-3.htm">&quot;Let me take a closer look at the envelope.&quot;</button>
