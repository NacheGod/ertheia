Adventurer Helpers. Yes, I do indeed have an 
item in need of delivering.
<br>
I need you to delievring this letter to <font color="LEVEL">Grand Magister</font>

<font color="LEVEL">Township</font>. A word of warning, do not read the 
contents of this letter... it could end poorly for 
you. Tifaren should be able to reward you upon 
delivery if this letter.
