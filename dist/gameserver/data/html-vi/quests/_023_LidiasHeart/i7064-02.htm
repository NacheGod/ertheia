The tenth day of the month of Shilen.<br>
Father's been very busy lately.<br1>
He and my brother stay up talking late into the night!<br1>
Visitors came this afternoon.<br1>
Usually, he would have offered them refreshments and small talk, but today he just escorted them directly into his den!<br1>
What's gotten into him?<br1>
