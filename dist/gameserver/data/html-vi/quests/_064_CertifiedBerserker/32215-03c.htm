"We cheated the raiders, and now we are retreating. Under seal of secrecy. But the enemy scouts want to warn the main force. First we need to prevent this operation. They went to the West, I contacted with Master Entien in Town of Dion and asked to find their scouts. Go to Dion Castle Village immediately and help to find them. If I get any message from Harkilgamed, I'll put it under the bridge".
