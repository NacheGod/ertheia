<html><body><font color="FFFFFF"> Gatekeeper Ziggurat:</font><br>
Borrowing power from Einhasad'a, Shunaiman, Emperor Elmoreden Empire, sealed the power of ancient magic here, right in this place. To guard the entrance to this place, the emperor placed inside the sphere of the human soul, and made her gatekeeper.<br>
I do not remember exactly what was needed for the whole soul of man that mechanism. Maybe it enslaves the soul and makes it subject to the Master Seals.<br>
However, the strength and power of ancient magic that is inactive until now, seems to become awakened. Not in my power to stop it all ... So I want to ask you for help.<br>
