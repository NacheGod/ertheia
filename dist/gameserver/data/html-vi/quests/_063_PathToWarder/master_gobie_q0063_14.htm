Did you deliver the report?<br>
I have recived deeply troubling news: our
Xekerin Troops were all but annihilated. Our
rangers discovered their corpses.<br>
Tak, the staff officer of the OI Mahum we sought
to captute, must have known of our plans!<br>
I have no additinal troops to devote to this task
-- what shall we do ?<br>
