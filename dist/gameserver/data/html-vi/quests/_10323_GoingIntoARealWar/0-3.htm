Are you ready? I want to tell you more about the 
task.
<br>
I want you to defeat the Husk Crawlers in the 
Training Grounds Underground Facility. First you 
must take the key I gave you to <font color="LEVEL">Holden</font> at the 
<font color="LEVEL">Training Grounds Underground Facility Entrance</font>. 
Tell him you`ve come to defeat the Husk 
Crawlers, and he`ll let you in.
<br>
If you lose key, come back to me. Once 
you`ve defeated all the Husk Crawlers, report to 
<font color="LEVEL">Shannon</font> at the <font color="LEVEL">Training Grounds</font>.
