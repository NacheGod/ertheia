Once again - this is important. <font color="LEVEL">earthworm eggs in the usual way does not destroy.</font> They are protected by a special shell that can be destroyed only by specially created insecticides. <br>
In total, there are three of the species. The earthworm lays <font color="LEVEL"> three types of </font> eggs. To destroy the eggs of each species should be used <font color="LEVEL"> some insecticide </font>. They say that if you use the wrong type of insecticide, it will cause internal metamorphosis in the egg, which will lead to a change of its kind ... and full restoration of health. <br>
And know that <font color="LEVEL"> egg can only be destroyed after three applications of insecticide.</font> As you can see, the destruction of the earthworm eggs - hard work, which requires well-coordinated teamwork. <br>
Keep this in mind.
