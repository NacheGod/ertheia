Letter from Queen Navari:<br>
Do you still remember that strange fragment you found last time?<br>
There are still more kind of this fragment near the area around Cruma Tower, an ancient ruin since The Giant's Glory Age. I need you to go there and investigate.<br><br>
For more details, first you have to find  <font color="LEVEL">High Priest Sylvian</font> at <font color="LEVEL">Einhasad's Temple in Town of Dion</font>.<br>

(I left a <font color="LEVEL">Scroll of Escape</font>along with the letter in this envelope. If you want to have a quick travel, then just use it.)
