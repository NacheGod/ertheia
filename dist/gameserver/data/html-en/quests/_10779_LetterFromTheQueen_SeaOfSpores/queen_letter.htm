Letter from Queen Navari:<br>
I heard you cant get anything from that Giants, instead, they even showed you their hostile.<br>
Now, just come back to Town of Oren, and show them our kindness, go meet up with <font color="LEVEL">High Priest Hollint</font> of <font color="LEVEL">Einhasad's Temple at Town of Oren</font>.<br>
(I left a <font color="LEVEL">Scroll of Escape</font>along with the letter in this envelope. If you want to have a quick travel, then just use it.)
