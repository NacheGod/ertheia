The twenty-fourth day of Shilen.<br>
Rose delivered my invitation to Nidrah, and he accepted too easily!<br>
I was so rushed when I made the preparations!<br1>
I must've made a thousand mistakes, but he never complained once!<br1>
Was he just being nice?<br1>
Or maybe he didn't care!<br>
He told me that he was here on business; business having nothing to do with our family.<br>
What is he up to?<br>
