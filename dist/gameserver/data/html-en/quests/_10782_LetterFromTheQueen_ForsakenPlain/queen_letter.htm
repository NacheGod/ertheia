Letter from Queen Navari:<br>
Members of our people was attacked by a total stranger at Forsaken Plains.<br>
Fortunately, no one gets hurt, but one of our asset has been lost<br>
Now you must go find <font color="LEVEL">High Priest Orven</font> of <font color="LEVEL"> Einhasad's Temple at Town of Aden</font>. He will tell you the details.<br>
