<html><body>Master Black:
<br>
Welcome! My name is Black and I am a
skillmaster to the Dark Elves.
<br>
I want to take a minute to tell you about the
different classes I train.
<br>
<font color="LEVEL">Dark Fighters</font> fight extremely quickly thanks to
their high Atk and Evasion rates.
<br>
<font color="LEVEL">Dark Mages</font> have powerful M. Atk and high
Healing abilities.
<br>
As you gain new levels stronger skills
become available a <font color="LEVEL">Skill Window icon will</font>
*automatically appear*. Click it to open your Skills
Windows. Futhermore, you can open your Skills
Windows by pressing <font color="LEVEL">ALT+K</font>, to see your Active,
Passive, and Skills you can learn.
