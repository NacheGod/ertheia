Letter from Queen Navari:<br>
Those Fragments found at near Cruma Tower is not related to what we are truly seeking.<br>Even thought, we can still get more clues from The Giants inside the tower.<br>
Now, go find  <font color="LEVEL">High Priest Sylvian</font> of <font color="LEVEL">Einhasad's Temple at Town of Dion</font> to ask more from his aid.<br>
(I left a <font color="LEVEL">Scroll of Escape</font>along with the letter in this envelope. If you want to have a quick travel, then just use it.)
