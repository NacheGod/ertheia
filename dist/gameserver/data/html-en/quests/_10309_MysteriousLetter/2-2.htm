Yes... given that you are still standing here I can 
tell you did nit read the letter. I fear Alisha has 
asked you to deliver this to the wrong person. 
This was a letter I originally intended to send to 
the <font color="LEVEL">Mysterius Wizard in the Forest of the Dead.</font>
<br>
I don`t suppose you would be willing to deliver 
this to the Mysterious Wizard? I`m sure he will be 
willing to pay you upon delivery of this letter.
