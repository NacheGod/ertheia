Tejakar Oroka!Hello, brother. I know the air surrond this land is making people feel uneasy, but what can we do about this? All places over the world is the same now.<br>
But at least, the Kamael here is friendly. There is one man called Zerstorer Marcela has pretty wide knowledge about weapon, if you intend to stay here for a long time then i suggest you go visit him once.<br>
But it seems to me that you are looking for new adventure. If thats the story then you should take a risk of the continent out there but not this small island. There will be much more stronger opponents, more potential threats and a lot of skills needed to learn -- things you never can find here.<br>
