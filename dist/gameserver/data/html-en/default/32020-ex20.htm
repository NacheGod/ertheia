Is this a Antharas Earing?  Hmm... it's okay I guess.  It isn't as interesting as a Blessed Antharas Earing.  You could be lucky enough to get one, or if you happen to aquire Antharas's Soul in a bottle you can create a Blessed Antharas Earing.  However the process is, well... different.  Tell you what, if you bring me these items I can make one for you.<br>
