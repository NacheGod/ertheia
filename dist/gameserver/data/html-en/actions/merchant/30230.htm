Ah, is this your first visit to Hunters Village? Then let me give you a bit of information about this town. Where should I start...<br>
This town was originally founded by hunters who came here seeking the rare game that inhabit this region. By rare game, of course, I mean creatures that are difficult and dangerous to hunt. Don't think that the founders were catching rabbits! Even now, the hunters of this town are every bit as "noble" as members of the royal family itself!<br>
