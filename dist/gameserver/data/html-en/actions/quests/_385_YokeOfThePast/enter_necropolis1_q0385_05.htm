Thank you! Now, go into the dungeon, kill all the <font color="LEVEL"> guardian of ancient cult </font> and bring me <font color="LEVEL"> scrolls of ancient magic </font>. When do I get the scroll, I will cast a magical spell itself, and in turn the scroll <font color="LEVEL"> blank scroll (blank scroll) </font>. This clean roll, perhaps, the only reward I can offer you ...<br>
You may have heard about the <font color="LEVEL"> Merchant of Mammon </font>, which often appears in the dungeon? He is very interested in this clean scroll. And you'll get what you deserve, finding it. I want to warn you that find it is not very easy ...<br>
