<html><body><font color="FFFFFF"> Gatekeeper Ziggurat:</font><br>
And the scope says again:<br>
One day, I was a man just like you. Under the influence of a powerful spell my body disappeared, and my soul was trapped in this very place. For several hundred years, I have worked here for a gatekeeper. But even they have erased my memory, so I do not know what kind of person I was. The only thing I remember is what I have to open the gates of the Master Seals.<br>
I certainly need your help, but you first have to gain more experience and skills ... And then come back, I will be very glad of your help.<br>
(Quest for characters level 20 and above.)
