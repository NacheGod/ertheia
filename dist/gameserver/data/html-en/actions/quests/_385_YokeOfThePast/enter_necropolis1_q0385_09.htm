Give me a scroll of ancient magic and make a step back ...<br>
... light cleaning. He applied to the darkness, and all is dark. The fire of the soul ... burns the darkness ...<br>
Done. The spell lifted. Here you go <font color="LEVEL"> Blank Scroll </font>, as I promised you.<br>
This will help you clean the scroll when you will communicate with the <font color="LEVEL"> Merchant of Mammon </font>, which appears from time to time in the sacred area.<br>
If you want to build more of Clean scrolls, go to the sacred area, kill <font color="LEVEL"> guardians of ancient cult </font> and bring me <font color="LEVEL"> scrolls of ancient magic </font>.<br>
