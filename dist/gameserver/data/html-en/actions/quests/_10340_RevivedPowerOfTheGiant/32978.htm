Wanderer! Good that you came. I wanted to ask you about something. You were in the Labyrinth Bellis?
Our scouts have found ruins. A deep underground tunnel connects them to the Labyrinth
Bellis. In this tunnel, the scouts are having trouble, and they ran away from there....
And now refuse to return. I would like to ask you to deal with it,
if you do not mind ...<br>
