It's unclear what happened, so that further research we can not.
But we have managed to do very much and would not want to throw it all in the middle.
One of the deceased before his death had a strange phrase to tell us ... "The king woke up."
The king, he talked about ... I think this is the Harnack, the king of ancient giants....
But he died long ago! Nature does not make exceptions ... So, I think the problem is something else.<br>
I would like to ask you to find out what sort of creatures attacked our scouts in the underground ruins,
and destroy them. Then we will be able to continue our research. I suspect that it could
Ghost be Harnack.<br>
