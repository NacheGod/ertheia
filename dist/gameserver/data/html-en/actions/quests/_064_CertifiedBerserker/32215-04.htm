I already know. Thank you!<br>
Meanwhile we found another plate with the message from our group. It says that they are moving to the Plains of the Lizardmen (<font color="LEVEL">Plains of the Lizardmen</font>). We sent them reinforcements–µ, but it was destroyed. The group also suffers big losses, and Harkilgamed is hiding with a item close to the  Plains of the Lizardmen.<br>
So go to the Plains, defeat the enemy and help Harkilgamed.<br>
