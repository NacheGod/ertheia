Welcome to Hunters Village. I received a message from Meldina the Great Master.
 
As you know, we protect an information.
 
This place doesn't look so impressive, but spies share their information here, conspiring...
 
The village is independent. This is what they need. In addition, some events took place here.
 
Be careful! Any trader can be dangerous.
 
We cooperate with spies from other races, but not for long time.
