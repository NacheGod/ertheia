<html><head><font color="FFFFFF">Holvas the Warehouse keeper:</font><br>
Think I see some hidden text.<br>
Huh...<br>
It seems like Kamael language, but much older.<br>
Yeah, dead language, a kind of encryption... I can't decipher it!<br>
But if you studied from <font color="LEVEL">Meldina the Grand Master of Kamael in Giran Castle</font>, you can decipher the inscription...<br>
Mmm... keep a copy of this text, just in case...<br>
Anyway, thank you for your help!<br>
