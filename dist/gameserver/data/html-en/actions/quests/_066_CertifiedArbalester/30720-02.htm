Huh!
 
Gauen had the nerve to say such a thing!?
 	
In fact he wanted to get <font color="LEVEL">Giants' research documents</font>! Greedy and hypocritical creature!<br>
He pretends a man of honor, but in reality it's not so.
 
I swear - we're saving the documents from Beleth and also from Gauen.
 
If he is so honest, why he contacted with Manashen?
