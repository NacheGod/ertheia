I heard that one dwarf found a book about your race, lost by Giants in Giants' Ruins.<br>
Unluckily, he was gone with the book. And nobody knows whether he is alive or dead.<br>
My old friend <font color="LEVEL">Holvas</font> told me about it, so turn to him â€” it will be much better.<br>
Maybe he knows where to find a copy of this book. Go to him!<br>
