Everyone is dead.<br1>
I was finally able to see Nidrah, by using some terrible tricks I won't divulge here!<br1>
I just had to see him!<br1>
He was my only hope!<br1>
He agreed to see me, even though he was in the middle of a ceremony!<br1>
He reminded me what he'd said before.<br1>
He said to have courage and act!<br1>
I'm sure now that the time is right!<br>
