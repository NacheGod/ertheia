Pa'agrio Tejakar! Welcome! I am High Prefect Finker, and I teach Orcs by the authority of Pa'agrio, the father of eternal fire, that we may once more attain the lost glory of our ancestors of old. My mission is to transform talented Orcs like you, my young friend, into strong and steely Orc warriors feared by all races. Do you wish to be reborn as a powerful Orc warrior?<br>
